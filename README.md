## Game Description:
A turn consists of playing one card from your hand on top of the discard pile.
If the rank of the played card matches the rank of the played card on the pile, the playing player collects the whole pile.
The collected cards are stored next to the player that collected the pile.
The next player will then start a new discard pile by playing a card on to the empty board. Playing a jack also captures the whole pile, no matter what card is on top of the pile.
If the played card is not a jack nor the rank is not equal to the previous top card of the pile, the played card is simply added to the top of the pile.
The player which makes the first capture also gets the cards which were dealt to the centre of the table.

When both the players have played their four cards, the game will deal another batch of four cards to each player from the stock(but no more to the centre of the table) and game continues.
When these cards are played, the game deals a further batch of four cards each.
When everyone has played their last four cards, any cards remaining in the discard pile are given to the last player that made a capture.
The game is now over, and the players score for the cards they have captured.

Each Jack = 1 point.
Each Ace = 1 point.
2 of Clubs = 2 points.
10 of Diamonds = 3 points.
Majority of cards = 3 points.
Each Pi≈üti = 10 points.
